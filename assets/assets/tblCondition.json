Contact Dermatitis is chronic, itchy inflammation of the skin caused by an external agent. The cause may be an irritant such as abrasives, chemicals (acids, alkalis), solvents and detergents or an allergen such as plants, fragrances, preservatives or metals such as nickel. Nickel sensitivity is seen in 10% women and 1% men. Individuals with atopic eczema are more susceptible to irritants. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a common, inflammatory skin condition that causes flaky scales to form on oily areas such as the scalp, eyebrows or inside the ear. It may be due to an overproduction of skin oil and irritation from yeast infection.",
